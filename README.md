Client with Real-Type Data Analysis (Neural Network)


@Sanay Devi 
Each folder consist of a separate Client Server, consisting of the same logic. You can click on any folder and follow the Readme in that folder. You can then run and connect it with other client and servers, specifying the port number and IP Address.


FaceEmotions is the package written completely by me, please have a look at that.
